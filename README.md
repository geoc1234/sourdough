## HeatMap
solves the heat equation for a hockey puck shaped mass of dough.  The shape is a first approximation to the shape of a round banneton used for making Sourdough. The equation is solved analytically, with the code being used to find the eigen values associated with the boundary conditions and initial condition.

## Factors
Calculates the growth rate of yeast and lactic acid bacteria based on values for Temperature, pH, NaCl wt%, and Ethanol vol%.  Parameters are extracted from the journal article APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY, July 1998, p. 2616–2623
